# Project: Driver

* Author: Brian Wu
* Class: CS452 Section #002
* Semester: Spring 2025

## Overview

A character drive that can read and write strings with provided separators.

## Reflection

While it was fun coding up the driver and making sure it builds I wasn't able to get it to run properly. I do believe the functionality is mostly there but I can get TryHello working (rather the driver). I'm unsure if I'm setting something up wrong, but nevertheless I'm uncertain if it is working. However, I mad esure to implement as much functionality as I could.

It was also fun to learn about the kernel space and its many functions. Figuring out how to transition data between the kernel and user space was interesting and I learned a lot in the process!

## Compiling and Using

To compile the code, first cd into the `Hello` directory.
Then, run this command 

```make```

and then...

```make TryHello```

and finally!

```./TryHello```

Just make sure the file structure is not disturbed and all should be good!

## Results 

However, the file builds but do to time constraints (my procrastination) I was not able to figure out why the try file isn't working. I also was not able to construct a test, and that will make grading a whole lot harder (sorry!).
